  The purpose of this website is to educate the end user about the health risks of obesity and provide information on beneficial nutrition through interactive media such as a B.M.I calculator, diet planner blog, quizzes and online games, whilst collecting quantitative data about the end user in order to help with further studies at the Charles Perkins Centre , while qualitative data is collected via surveys to help with the website's functionality.

The targeted end users are split up into easily defined groups so the website can collect data on specific age groups and also provide targeted information in a format relevant to those specifically targeted. The different end users are as following, "Parents and Kids", "Teens" and "Uni students".
